# _printf 📄
A formatted output conversion C program completed as part of the low-level programming and algorithm track at Alx-Holberton School. The program is a pseudo- recreation of the C standard library function, `printf`.

## Dependencies 👫
The `_printf` function was coded on an Ubuntu1~20.04.1 LTS machine with gcc version 9.4.0.

## Usage 🏃
To use the `_printf` function, assuming the above dependencies have been installed, compile all `.c` files in the repository and include the header main.h with any main function.

Example `main.c`:
```
#include "main.h"

int main(void)
{
    _printf("Hello, World!");

    return (0);
}
```
Compilation:
```
$ gcc *.c -o tester
```
Output:
```
$ ./tester
Hello, World!
$
```
## Description 💬
The function `_printf` writes output to standard output. The function writes under the control of a `format` string that specifies how subsequent arguments (accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of `stdarg`) are converted for output.

Prototype: `int _printf(const char *format, ...);`

### Return Value
Upon successful return, `_printf` returns the number of characters printed (excluding the terminating null byte used to end output to strings). If an output error is encountered, the function returns `-1`.

## Format of the Argument String
The `format` string argument is a constant character string composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not `%`) which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Conversion specification is introduced by the character `%` and ends with a conversion specifier. In between the `%` character and conversion specifier, there may be (in order) zero or more _flags_, an optional minimum _field width___, an optional precision and an optional _length_ modifier. The arguments must correspond with the conversion specifier, and are used in the order given.
