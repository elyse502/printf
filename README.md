The printf function sends formatted output to stdout. A custom _printf() for learning purposes was developed by cohort #13 students `Elysée NIYIBIZI` and `Samuel IMANANIYOGAKIZA`. _printf() function format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. These arguments are placed using the percentage '%' operator. This project was developed with the help of **C programming language.**

The _printf() function produces output according to a format which is described below. This function write its output to the stdout, the standard output. Returns the count of printed characters when the function is successful The available convertion specifiers are:

* %c: Prints a single character.
* %s: Prints a string of characters.
* %d: Prints integers.
* %i: Prints integers.
* %b: Prints the binary representation of an unsigned decimal.
* %u: Prints unsigned integers.
* %x: Prints the hexadecial representation of an unsigned decimal in lowercase letters.
* %X:Prints the hexadecial representation of an unsigned decimal in uppercase letters.
* %r: Prints a reversed string.

### Usage:

* All the files are to be compiled on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* Include the "main.h" header file on the Functions using the _printf()!.
